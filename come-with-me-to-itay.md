# Come Travel with Me to ITALY!

At the end of August I was feeling a bit drained. I just had ACL surgery in April, and had only recovered a few short weeks when we started traveling Europe hard. I moved abroad to travel and I wasn't going to let an injury stop me! There was one trip I was particularly excited, and if I'm honest, nervous about because I had no idea what was in store. I was hosting my very first trip in Europe. Readers from all over the world were coming to travel with Michael and me in Portugal. We traveled the far reaches of Western Europe- Lisbon, Porto, and Lagos. What transpired was not only a crazy, cool destination, delicious food, tours, and some blogging, photography, and Instagram training, but, most importantly, lifelong friendships.

The trip was so good, I knew I had to do it again.

Which is why I'm thrilled to announce…

**We're going to ITALY!!!**

**I would love for you to come travel with me to Italy. Specifically, Rome, Florence, and Cinque Terre. Now, let me tell you all that's in store.**
