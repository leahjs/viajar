# The Best Winter Destinations in Europe

## Zermatt, Switzerland
The falling snow was mesmerizing as I sat by the window, overlooking the quiet town below. Not a car in sight or a soul walking around â€“ only skiers gliding down well worn paths. I was in Zermatt, Switzerland and the ever looming Matterhorn had yet to be seen. After days of not seeing this incredible mountain, the clouds finally parted, the snow lifted, and she stood proudly.

## Strasbourg, France
There is no city in the world that transforms into a Christmas wonderland quite like Strasbourg. Every single window and lane is decorated from nearly top to bottom with lights and even stuffed animals.  It's a gingerbread town come to life with the half-timbered houses and the lively Christmas markets, shopping, and the traditions of German Christmas markets spilling over from the nearby country. Check out my full guide for what to do in Strasbourg for Christmas. Since you're in the area I suggest taking a short trip over to Baden Baden, Heidelberg, or The Black Forest in Germany for the traditional markets.

## The Austrian Alps
In the summer months you'll find miles of green and the sound of bells on cows as they roam the wide open hills. But winter frosts the ground and makes everything feel like a wonderland. The rough peaks of the alps are truly an incredible sight and the tall steeples from the churches in the towns below make you feel like you're stepping back in time.
